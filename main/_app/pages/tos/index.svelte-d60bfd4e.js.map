To\n      that end, this document establishes various acknowledgements, entitlements, and restrictions in regards to the\n      usage of ficsit.app websites, content, systems, and software. ficsit.app reserves the right to discontinue\n      providing any or all of these services, as well as cease any form of communications, to any user or organisation\n      and for any reason and at any time.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Changes to Policies and Services</h2>\n    <p>\n      We reserve the right to change this document, as well as our various policies and guidelines, at any time. By\n      continuing to use the service, you automatically agree to any revisions of these terms.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      ficsit.app reserves the right to reconfigure its offerings and organisation and may choose to do so at any time.\n      This includes but is not limited to our services, website designs, membership pricing and offerings, advertising\n      programs and partnerships, as well as staff related and/or administrative restructuring.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>General Usage of Websites and Services</h2>\n    <p>\n      By accessing ficsit.app services, you hereby represent that you are aged 18 or older, or that you are aged 13 or\n      older and do so with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You will use ficsit.app services reasonably and as intended. You may not display, duplicate, dismantle, reverse\n      engineer, circumvent, or repurpose any property or service owned or operated by ficsit.app without consent. You\n      will not intentionally harm, disparage, or in any way disrupt the operation of ficsit.app websites, systems,\n      property, or staff. You view and use all content at your own risk. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or\n      usefulness of any content presented. User-submitted content expresses the views of the author, not necessarily the\n      views of any staff at ficsit.app.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the interest of upholding our community standards when it comes to etiquette, we ask you to abstain from\n      interacting with user-submitted content that you do not find to your liking, rather than engaging in active\n      disparagement of content you disapprove of.\n    </p>\n    <p>The ficsit.app API may not be used in any application that is closed-source.</p>\n\n    <h2>Fair Use Policy</h2>\n    <p>\n      Attempting to download files or otherwise record data offered through our services (including but not limited to\n      the ficsit.app website and the ficsit.app API) in a fashion that drastically exceeds the expected average, through\n      the use of software automation or otherwise, is prohibited without expressed permission. Users found in violation\n      of this policy will have their account suspended.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Anti-Piracy Policy</h2>\n    <p>\n      We have a strict anti-piracy policy and will take proactive action against anyone whose on-site activity gives us\n      reasonable grounds to believe they are using pirated content such as, but not limited to, games and software.\n      Discussing, promoting or distributing such content on our sites will be met with administrative action.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Accounts and User Identity</h2>\n    <p>\n      In order to access certain ficsit.app services, you must create and utilise a singular account (i.e. one account\n      per person) consisting of a username, email address, and password. Households or facilities from which multiple\n      users (and therefore accounts) may access the sites and services are encouraged to inform staff to ensure that\n      there are no potential misunderstandings in the case of moderation review. Users who create multiple accounts may\n      have any or all of those accounts terminated with other measures being taken to prevent such abuse as appropriate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It is your responsibility to ensure the email address attached to your account is up-to-date. In the event of you\n      losing access to your account, your email address is the only method that can be used to reclaim your account.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When creating an account on our services, the username you choose must be appropriate for all audiences (i.e. be\n      free of profanity). Accounts registered with inappropriate usernames will be subject to an immediate ban. It is\n      important that you keep your account information secure. ficsit.app is not responsible for any unauthorised use of\n      your account. It is the sole responsibility of the user to keep these records up to date and your failure to do so\n      may lead to you losing access to your account.\n    </p>\n    <p>We encourage you not to disclose any personally identifying information on our services.</p>\n    <p>\n      By creating an account, you understand and agree that access to these services may be restricted at our\n      discretion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Avatar and signature images shall comply with the site rules. If you are using links in your signature or on your\n      profile page, please make sure that content featured on the linked website or webpage conforms to our\n      requirements. Ensure that any animated images you would like to use as your avatar do not contain excessively\n      involved animations that can be construed as overly distracting. We reserve the right to remove animated avatars\n      at our sole discretion.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>User-submitted Content</h2>\n    <p>\n      User-submitted content includes all data submitted to our services by a ficsit.app user. ficsit.app does not claim\n      any ownership of your content. By submitting content to our services, you are granting an infinite, non-exclusive,\n      worldwide, royalty-free license for ficsit.app to store, distribute, copy or reproduce, edit, translate, reformat,\n      publicly display, or perform the submitted content, at our discretion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      All user-submitted content is provided for personal use. You are not entitled to redistribute, repackage, sell, or\n      otherwise distribute content without express permission from the associated content owner(s), and/or other\n      invested parties, when applicable.

The mere existence of a file violating our rules on\n      our services does not imply our approval of, or indifference to said file. As such, user-submitted content which\n      is found to be in violation of our standards is not excusable based on the existence of other, similar\n      submissions.\n    </p>\n    <p>Any user-submitted content may not contain links to off-site mod binaries or archives.</p>\n\n    <h2>Prohibited and Illicit Content</h2>\n    <p>\n      Content deemed illegal by US law, including but not limited to pornographic depictions of sexual violence,\n      indecent depictions of minors, bestiality, necrophilia, etc., is strictly prohibited and will result in\n      administrative action and when appropriate, notification to the proper authorities.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\n    <p>\n      ficsit.app is not liable for any damages incurred through the use of its services, including that which may be\n      associated with the user-submitted content. You agree that any use of user-submitted content or modifications made\n      to your property is done at your own risk.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      By submitting content to our services, you accept full responsibility for and absolve ficsit.app of any\n      liabilities associated with your submitted content, including any potential damages it may incur to anyone's\n      property or well-being, directly or indirectly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      ficsit.app is not responsible for any charges or fees incurred by any third-party service provider(s) that may\n      result from the use of our services.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      All ficsit.app services are provided as-is.
