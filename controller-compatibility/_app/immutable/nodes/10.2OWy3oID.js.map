Multiplayer interaction and game-to-game synchronization are the\n      only exceptions. Examples include, but are not limited to:<br />\n      • API integrations with 3rd party services<br />\n      • Links to external sites or services, which should explicitly be marked as such\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Paid Content</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Mods can advertise the payment or donation platform of their choice¹ as long as it does not create any intrusive\n      advertisement experience for a player. If an API is used, it must be included in the description of the mod as\n      part of the network activity transparency. If a link is displayed in game, the full url must be visible, (as this\n      is for safety's sake, no url shorteners may be used).\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Mods cannot lock features behind any form of payment, donation, or subscription. Mods can have early access\n      versions of itself behind payment, donation, or subscription as long as the intent is to release the early access\n      version to the public within a reasonable timeframe.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>Mods cannot include a 'remove ads' payment, donation, or subscription feature.</p>\n\n    <small>\n      ¹ We reserve the right to restrict the use of certain platforms or payment and donation methods.
