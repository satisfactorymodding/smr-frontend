    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
      ficsit.app strives to provide its users with services and information that facilitate the discussion and
      distribution of user-submitted video game modifications ("mods") and other video game related digital media. To
      that end, this document establishes various acknowledgements, entitlements, and restrictions in regards to the
      usage of ficsit.app websites, content, systems, and software. ficsit.app reserves the right to discontinue
      providing any or all of these services, as well as cease any form of communications, to any user or organisation
      and for any reason and at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to Policies and Services</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to change this document, as well as our various policies and guidelines, at any time. By
      continuing to use the service, you automatically agree to any revisions of these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      ficsit.app reserves the right to reconfigure its offerings and organisation and may choose to do so at any time.
      This includes but is not limited to our services, website designs, membership pricing and offerings, advertising
      programs and partnerships, as well as staff related and/or administrative restructuring.
    </p>

    <h2>General Usage of Websites and Services</h2>
    <p>
      By accessing ficsit.app services, you hereby represent that you are aged 18 or older, or that you are aged 13 or
      older and do so with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will use ficsit.app services reasonably and as intended. You may not display, duplicate, dismantle, reverse
      engineer, circumvent, or repurpose any property or service owned or operated by ficsit.app without consent. You
      will not intentionally harm, disparage, or in any way disrupt the operation of ficsit.app websites, systems,
      property, or staff. You view and use all content at your own risk. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or
      usefulness of any content presented. User-submitted content expresses the views of the author, not necessarily the
      views of any staff at ficsit.app.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interest of upholding our community standards when it comes to etiquette, we ask you to abstain from
      interacting with user-submitted content that you do not find to your liking, rather than engaging in active
      disparagement of content you disapprove of.
    </p>
    <p>The ficsit.app API may not be used in any application that is closed-source.</p>

    <h2>Fair Use Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Attempting to download files or otherwise record data offered through our services (including but not limited to
      the ficsit.app website and the ficsit.app API) in a fashion that drastically exceeds the expected average, through
      the use of software automation or otherwise, is prohibited without expressed permission. Users found in violation
      of this policy will have their account suspended.
    </p>

    <h2>Anti-Piracy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We have a strict anti-piracy policy and will take proactive action against anyone whose on-site activity gives us
      reasonable grounds to believe they are using pirated content such as, but not limited to, games and software.
      Discussing, promoting or distributing such content on our sites will be met with administrative action.
    </p>

    <h2>Accounts and User Identity</h2>
    <p>
      In order to access certain ficsit.app services, you must create and utilise a singular account (i.e. one account
      per person) consisting of a username, email address, and password. Households or facilities from which multiple
      users (and therefore accounts) may access the sites and services are encouraged to inform staff to ensure that
      there are no potential misunderstandings in the case of moderation review. Users who create multiple accounts may
      have any or all of those accounts terminated with other measures being taken to prevent such abuse as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is your responsibility to ensure the email address attached to your account is up-to-date. In the event of you
      losing access to your account, your email address is the only method that can be used to reclaim your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating an account on our services, the username you choose must be appropriate for all audiences (i.e. be
      free of profanity). Accounts registered with inappropriate usernames will be subject to an immediate ban. It is
      important that you keep your account information secure. ficsit.app is not responsible for any unauthorised use of
      your account. It is the sole responsibility of the user to keep these records up to date and your failure to do so
      may lead to you losing access to your account.
    </p>
    <p>We encourage you not to disclose any personally identifying information on our services.</p>
    <p>
      By creating an account, you understand and agree that access to these services may be restricted at our
      discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avatar and signature images shall comply with the site rules. If you are using links in your signature or on your
      profile page, please make sure that content featured on the linked website or webpage conforms to our
      requirements. Ensure that any animated images you would like to use as your avatar do not contain excessively
      involved animations that can be construed as overly distracting. We reserve the right to remove animated avatars
      at our sole discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>User-submitted Content</h2>
    <p>
      User-submitted content includes all data submitted to our services by a ficsit.app user. ficsit.app does not claim
      any ownership of your content. By submitting content to our services, you are granting an infinite, non-exclusive,
      worldwide, royalty-free license for ficsit.app to store, distribute, copy or reproduce, edit, translate, reformat,
      publicly display, or perform the submitted content, at our discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All user-submitted content is provided for personal use. You are not entitled to redistribute, repackage, sell, or
      otherwise distribute content without express permission from the associated content owner(s), and/or other
      invested parties, when applicable. For more information, refer to any applicable documentation included or
      associated with the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, you understand that we reserve the right to remove any content with or without reason at our
      discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the volume of user-submitted content on our services, we rely on community reports and reactive moderation
      when it comes to upholding our various rules and guidelines. The mere existence of a file violating our rules on
      our services does not imply our approval of, or indifference to said file. As such, user-submitted content which
      is found to be in violation of our standards is not excusable based on the existence of other, similar
      submissions.
    </p>
    <p>Any user-submitted content may not contain links to off-site mod binaries or archives.</p>

    <h2>Prohibited and Illicit Content</h2>
    <p>
      Content deemed illegal by US law, including but not limited to pornographic depictions of sexual violence,
      indecent depictions of minors, bestiality, necrophilia, etc., is strictly prohibited and will result in
      administrative action and when appropriate, notification to the proper authorities.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      ficsit.app is not liable for any damages incurred through the use of its services, including that which may be
      associated with the user-submitted content. You agree that any use of user-submitted content or modifications made
      to your property is done at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      By submitting content to our services, you accept full responsibility for and absolve ficsit.app of any
      liabilities associated with your submitted content, including any potential damages it may incur to anyone's
      property or well-being, directly or indirectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ficsit.app is not responsible for any charges or fees incurred by any third-party service provider(s) that may
      result from the use of our services.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ficsit.app services are provided as-is. Though we attempt to ensure that our services are consistent and
      functional, we do not guarantee service for any length of time or any measure of quality.
    </p>

    <h2>Email Communications</h2>
    <p>
      By creating a ficsit.app account, you acknowledge that we may send email to the address associated with your
      account with important information regarding your account, as well as our services and policies.
